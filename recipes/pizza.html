    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is great</p>
    <p>
        A slice of classic cheese pizza is one of life's greatest pleasures. 
        While calling for delivery is always a treat, 
        being able to make your own pizza recipes at home is even more satisfying. 
        This recipe covers the basics: kneading a simple dough, stretching it into a round, 
        and cranking up your oven to get that perfect char. The tasty reward is a crispy-bottomed, 
        airy crust topped with tangy tomato sauce, and milky mozzarella.
